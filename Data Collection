The first step of this study was to create a dataset with the probability that each contribution made by a party leader belongs to a 
 particular moral foundation.
 
 Therefore, I needed to download every debate that took place in the House of Commons since 1979; I did that using the text scraped debates that 
 'They Work For You' scraped from Hansard. You can find that page here: https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pwdata/scrapedxml/debates/.
 
 Each file is a .xml file, which needed to be downloaded. I used a Google Chrome Extension (DownThemAll, find it here: https://www.downthemall.org/howto/
 help/english-menu/batch-downloadsbatch-descriptors/) to do this. 
 
 I end up with a folder on my computer of each debate ever undertaken in the House of Commons, since the required date.
