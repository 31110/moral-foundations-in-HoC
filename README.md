# An analysis of the difference between UK Political Parties’ endorsement of moral foundations in the UK House of Commons.


Abstract:

The development of ’systems thinking’ has given rise to theories attempting to explain how individuals make quick, intuitive political decisions. A fundamental theory in that field is the Moral Foundation Theory (MFT), which hypothesises that left-wing thinkers endorse the ’moral foundations’ of Care and Fairness more than their right-wing counterparts. Whilst right-wing thinkers endorse the morals of Authority, Loyalty, and Sanctity more than their left-wing counterparts. This paper uses logistic regression models to identify whether higher endorsements of those morals in contributions made by party leaders in the UK House of Commons predict whether those politicians were the leaders of the Labour or Conservative Party. This paper extends this method to identify whether statistical differences exist between the four main parties and whether high endorsements of moral foundations have any relationship with the party polling. I find that high endorsement of Care and Fairness are statistically significant predictors of the Labour Party, whilst higher endorsements of Authority, Loyalty, and Sanctity are statistically significant predictors of the Conservative Party. However, this paper finds little relationship between the endorsement of moral foundations and a parties’ electoral performance.
